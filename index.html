     <h1> Binary </h1>
<p> <h3> binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, a method for representing numbers that uses only two symbols for the natural numbers: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one). A binary number may also refer to a rational number that has a finite representation in the binary numeral system, that is, the quotient of an integer by a power of two.</h3>

      <h1>History of Binary Codes</h1>

      <h3> As currently used in computers and devices around the world, binary code was invented when the German polymath,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz"> Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz</a> (1646-1716), introduced a system of using only the binary digits 0 and 1 to perform arithmetic operations.</h3>

    <div> <h1>The uses of binary numbers</h1>
   <h3> Binary plays a critical role in computing because it allows computers to store and manipulate data using a system of switches that can be turned on or off, represented by the digits 0 and 1 . This binary code can represent any type of data, from text and numbers to images and sound.</h3> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQbNNMFoqSLXC0z9y0KldRMMateSQ0YPGf72w&s" alt="" width="600">
